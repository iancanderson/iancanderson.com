### The idea

Recently I built [Hurdle](https://hurdle.iancanderson.com), which is a [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)-like game where you have to guess the "correct" equation. I wasn't sure if a math game like this would be fun or not, but people have been enjoying it!

### The code

Hurdle is a fork of [word-master](https://octokatherine.github.io/word-master/).

Like word-master, Hurdle is built with TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS.

Check out the associated GitHub repos:
