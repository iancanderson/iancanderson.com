  This one goes out to my dad Dale Anderson who, in addition being a wonderful
  father figure, backed my Kickstarter project for my debut album.  His reward
  was getting to choose a song for me cover on YouTube - and here it is!


  Thanks to my dad and other Kickstarter backers, I'm proud to be releasing my
  debut album, entitled "Perennials."  To listen for free or to buy the physical
  disc and/or download, head here:

  PS: I'm aware that I messed up one of the lyrics in the beginning ("smile"
  should be "shine").  Maybe now it could double as a toothpaste commercial?


  Oh 1986.  Two great things were released into the world: "Lady in Red" as well
  as a bald redhead...
