videoDescription: "I'm learning the XNA game framework.  This is example 1 of my progress: simple sprite animations, dynamic creation and deletion of game objects, and random positioning.\r\nUp arrow increases the amount of 'players' by 1; down arrow decreases the amount by 1.  Left and right arrows move all of the 'players.'"
