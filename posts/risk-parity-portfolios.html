<h2>Free lunch?</h2>
<p>From what I can tell, there aren&#x27;t a lot of &quot;free lunches&quot; in investing. Either you take more risk and get rewarded (with a lot of volatility in the meantime), or you take less risk and get lower returns with less volatility. It turns out, risk-parity portfolios can kind of get you a free lunch: more reward with the same risk as a more &quot;standard&quot; portfolio (or less risk with the same reward).</p>
<h2>Risk parity?</h2>
<p>I first heard about risk parity from Frank Vasquez when he was a <a href="https://www.choosefi.com/are-you-as-diversified-as-you-think-you-are-with-frank-vasquez-ep-313/">guest on the Choose FI podcast</a>. Since then I&#x27;ve really been enjoying his <a href="https://www.riskparityradio.com">Risk Parity Radio podcast</a>.</p>
<p>The general idea of risk parity is to reduce risk without reducing expected returns, by investing in several uncorrelated assets.</p>
<p>In this context &quot;uncorrelated&quot; can mean either asset with negative correlation (e.g. stocks vs treasury bonds) or assets with near-zero correlation (e.g. stocks vs gold).</p>
<p>The most common asset classes in these portfolios are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks (index funds / ETFs)</li>
<li>Long-term treasury bonds (government bonds)</li>
<li>Gold (ETFs)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Correlations</h2>
<p>Here are the correlations between each asset class vs the total US stock market since 1987:</p>
<h3>Total stock market: 1.00</h3>
<p>Right. The total stock market is perfectly correlated with itself, so its ratio is 1.00.</p>
<h3>Long term treasury bonds: -0.14</h3>
<p>Long term treasury bonds are the most negatively correlated with stocks. This means that when stocks tank, long term treasury bonds will generally rise as investors look for safety.</p>
<h3>Total US bond market: 0.07</h3>
<p>The total US bond market includes both government bonds and corporate bonds. Corporate bonds generally rise and fall with stocks, so they&#x27;re not as useful as government bonds for the purpose of reducing correlation between portfolio assets.</p>
<h3>Gold: -0.02</h3>
<p>Gold generally has zero-ish correlation with stocks. You can think of gold as kind of &quot;doing its own thing&quot; in relation to stocks and bonds.</p>
<h2>The 60/40</h2>
<p>The &quot;60/40&quot; portfolio has become a kind of standard, relatively conservative portfolio, consisting of 60% total stock market and 40% total bond market.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s compare the performance of the 60/40 portfolio with a portfolio with less-correlated assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% total stock market</li>
<li>30% long term treasury bonds</li>
<li>20% gold</li>
</ul>
<p>I ran a backtest on portfolio visualizer to analyze the <a href="https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&amp;mode=1&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1972&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2022&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;leverageType=0&amp;leverageRatio=0.0&amp;debtAmount=0&amp;debtInterest=0.0&amp;maintenanceMargin=25.0&amp;leveragedBenchmark=false&amp;portfolioNames=true&amp;portfolioName1=60%2F40&amp;portfolioName2=50%2F30%2F20+stocks%2FLTT%2Fgold&amp;asset1=TotalStockMarket&amp;allocation1_1=60&amp;allocation1_2=50&amp;asset2=TotalBond&amp;allocation2_1=40&amp;asset3=SmallCapValue&amp;asset4=ShortTreasury&amp;asset5=LongTreasury&amp;allocation5_2=30&amp;asset6=Gold&amp;allocation6_2=20">performance of each portfolio since 1987</a>.</p>
<h3>CAGR</h3>
<p>The compound annual growth rates for the 2 portfolios were:</p>
<ul>
<li>60/40: 9.09%</li>
<li>50/30/20: 9.14%</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost exactly the same returns, even with 10% fewer stocks.</p>
<h3>Best year</h3>
<ul>
<li>60/40: 28.74%</li>
<li>50/30/20: 27.12%</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty close!</p>
<h3>Worst year</h3>
<p>Here&#x27;s where things get interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>60/40: -20.20%</li>
<li>50/30/20: -10.78%</li>
</ul>
<p>In the worst year, the 50/30/20 portfolio&#x27;s losses were about half compared to the 60/40 portfolio! Roughly equivalent returns over time, with much less downside. Enjoy that free lunch!</p>
<p>The Sortino Ratio and the Sharpe Ratio were both higher for the 50/30/20 portfolio, which makes sense because these ratios measure the returns of the portfolios in comparison to their risk/downsides.</p>
<h2>Matching the total stock market returns with less volatility</h2>
<p>&quot;60/40, you say? That&#x27;s for retirees, right? What if I&#x27;m young and willing to tolerate more risk?&quot;</p>
<p>Risk parity portfolios can also match the returns of the total stock market with less volatility and drawdowns.</p>
<p>This usually happens via leverage / margin. For example, we can keep the same relative proportions in the 50/30/20 portfolio, but add leverage so that the effective exposure of the portfolio is 120% instead of 100%.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what that could look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>60% total stock market</li>
<li>36% long term treasury bonds</li>
<li>24% gold</li>
<li>-20% cash (this represents the leverage to make the portfolio add up to 100%)</li>
</ul>
<p>We should expect higher returns from the leveraged portfolio compared to the 50/30/20 portfolio. Let&#x27;s compare this leveraged portfolio with a straight 100% total stock market allocation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2022&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;leverageType=0&amp;leverageRatio=0.0&amp;debtAmount=0&amp;debtInterest=0.0&amp;maintenanceMargin=25.0&amp;leveragedBenchmark=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=VTSAX&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;allocation1_2=60&amp;symbol2=TLT&amp;allocation2_2=36&amp;symbol3=GLD&amp;allocation3_2=24&amp;symbol4=CASHX&amp;allocation4_2=-20">Portfolio visualizer analysis since 2004</a></p>
<h3>CAGR</h3>
<p>The compound annual growth rates for the 2 portfolios were:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% stock: 10.25%</li>
<li>60/36/24/-20: 11.14%</li>
</ul>
<p>We did it! Higher returns than the stock market.</p>
<h3>Best year</h3>
<ul>
<li>100% stock: 33.52%</li>
<li>60/36/24/-20: 27.39%</li>
</ul>
<p>The highs aren&#x27;t as high, but still pretty darn good.</p>
<h3>Worst year</h3>
<p>Again, here&#x27;s where these portfolios shine.</p>
<ul>
<li>100% stock: -50.84%</li>
<li>60/36/24/-20: -22.26%</li>
</ul>
<p>As before, the risk parity portfolio has average returns that match (or exceed) the comparison portfolio. But in the worst year, the downside is <em>less than half</em>. A 50% loss in your portfolio is pretty scary, and can tempt you to do drastic (and suboptimal) things like selling out of stocks while they&#x27;re low, and missing the inevitable comeback.</p>
<p>Again, the Sortino and Sharpe ratios are much higher for the risk parity portfolio, indicative of the similar returns with less risk.</p>
<h3>Leverage? How?</h3>
<p>The easiest way to get a leveraged portfolio is to buy ETFs that have leverage built-in.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>UPRO</code> is an ETF that is a 3x leveraged S&amp;P 500 fund. This means that when the S&amp;P 500 rises or falls by a given percentage, <code>UPRO</code> will move in the same direction, but 3x as much.</li>
<li><code>TMF</code> is an ETF that is a 3x leveraged long-term treasury bond fund. This means that when the long-term treasury bond market rises or falls by a given percentage, <code>TMF</code> will move in the same direction, but 3x as much.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example portfolio that recently made some waves in financial forums is called &quot;Hedgefundie&#x27;s Excellent Adventure.&quot; It&#x27;s comprised completely of <code>UPRO</code> and <code>TMF</code>, the most recent rendition being 55% in <code>UPRO</code> and 45% in <code>TMF</code>.</p>
<p>The backtesting results are impressive to say the least, with a ~16.7% annual return since 1987, compared to 9.87% for the S&amp;P 500, all while maintaining similar downside to the S&amp;P500. See this article for a summary and backtest of the hedgefunie&#x27;s excellent adventure portfolio: <a href="https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/">HEDGEFUNDIE’s Excellent Adventure (UPRO/TMF) – A Summary</a>. This is an experimental portfolio. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d actually go for this for my main portfolio, but it&#x27;s a good illustration for how leverage can be used to make a portfolio more efficient.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Stocks are great, but they&#x27;re volatile and scary if they&#x27;re all you have. Use some gold and long term treasuries to diversify your portfolio, and consider leverage to get even better returns while keeping volatility relatively low.</p>
