Either you take more risk and get rewarded (with a lot of volatility in the meantime), or you take less risk and get lower returns with less volatility. It turns out, risk-parity portfolios can kind of get you a free lunch: more reward with the same risk as a more &quot;standard&quot; portfolio (or less risk with the same reward).</p><h2>Risk parity?</h2><p>I first heard about risk parity from Frank Vasquez when he was a <a href="https://www.choosefi.com/are-you-as-diversified-as-you-think-you-are-with-frank-vasquez-ep-313/">guest on the Choose FI podcast</a>. Since then I&#x27;ve really been enjoying his <a href="https://www.riskparityradio.com">Risk Parity Radio podcast</a>.</p><p>The general idea of risk parity is to reduce risk without reducing expected returns, by investing in several uncorrelated assets.</p><p>In this context &quot;uncorrelated&quot; can mean either asset with negative correlation (e.g. stocks vs treasury bonds) or assets with near-zero correlation (e.g. stocks vs gold).</p><p>The most common asset classes in these portfolios are:</p><ul><li>Stocks (index funds / ETFs)</li><li>Long-term treasury bonds (government bonds)</li><li>Gold (ETFs)</li></ul><h2>Correlations</h2><p>Here are the correlations between each asset class vs the total US stock market since 1987:</p><h3>Total stock market: 1.00</h3><p>Right. The total stock market is perfectly correlated with itself, so its ratio is 1.00.</p><h3>Long term treasury bonds: -0.14</h3><p>Long term treasury bonds are the most negatively correlated with stocks. This means that when stocks tank, long term treasury bonds will generally rise as investors look for safety.</p><h3>Total US bond market: 0.07</h3><p>The total US bond market includes both government bonds and corporate bonds. Corporate bonds generally rise and fall with stocks, so they&#x27;re not as useful as government bonds for the purpose of reducing correlation between portfolio assets.</p><h3>Gold: -0.02</h3><p>Gold generally has zero-ish correlation with stocks.

But in the worst year, the downside is <em>less than half</em>. A 50% loss in your portfolio is pretty scary, and can tempt you to do drastic (and suboptimal) things like selling out of stocks while they&#x27;re low, and missing the inevitable comeback.</p><p>Again, the Sortino and Sharpe ratios are much higher for the risk parity portfolio, indicative of the similar returns with less risk.</p><h3>Leverage? How?</h3><p>The easiest way to get a leveraged portfolio is to buy ETFs that have leverage built-in.</p><ul><li><code>UPRO</code> is an ETF that is a 3x leveraged S&amp;P 500 fund. This means that when the S&amp;P 500 rises or falls by a given percentage, <code>UPRO</code> will move in the same direction, but 3x as much.</li><li><code>TMF</code> is an ETF that is a 3x leveraged long-term treasury bond fund. This means that when the long-term treasury bond market rises or falls by a given percentage, <code>TMF</code> will move in the same direction, but 3x as much.</li></ul><p>An example portfolio that recently made some waves in financial forums is called &quot;Hedgefundie&#x27;s Excellent Adventure.&quot; It&#x27;s comprised completely of <code>UPRO</code> and <code>TMF</code>, the most recent rendition being 55% in <code>UPRO</code> and 45% in <code>TMF</code>.</p><p>The backtesting results are impressive to say the least, with a ~16.7% annual return since 1987, compared to 9.87% for the S&amp;P 500, all while maintaining similar downside to the S&amp;P500. See this article for a summary and backtest of the hedgefunie&#x27;s excellent adventure portfolio: <a href="https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/">HEDGEFUNDIE’s Excellent Adventure (UPRO/TMF) – A Summary</a>. This is an experimental portfolio. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d actually go for this for my main portfolio, but it&#x27;s a good illustration for how leverage can be used to make a portfolio more efficient.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Stocks are great, but they&#x27;re volatile and scary if they&#x27;re all you have. Use some gold and long term treasuries to diversify your portfolio, and consider leverage to get even better returns while keeping volatility relatively low.</p><h3>Further reading / listening</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.riskparityradio.com">https://www.riskparityradio.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.riskparityradio.com/portfolios">https://www.riskparityradio.com/portfolios</a></li><li><a href="https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/09/22/catching-a-golden-butterfly/">https://portfoliocharts.com/2015/09/22/catching-a-golden-butterfly/</a></li><li><a href="https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/04/18/the-theory-behind-the-golden-butterfly/">https://portfoliocharts.com/2016/04/18/the-theory-behind-the-golden-butterfly/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-parity.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-parity.asp</a></li></ul></div></div></article></div></main></div><footer class="bg-neutral-50 border-t border-neutral-200"><div class="container mx-auto px-5"><div class="py-6 flex items-center justify-end"><div class="text-sm text-[color:var(--brutal-fg)]"><span class="mr-2 font-semibold">theme:</span><span><a href="#" class="hover:underline">one</a><span class="mx-2">|</span></span><span><a href="#" class="font-extrabold">two</a><span class="mx-2">|</span></span><span><a href="#" class="hover:underline">three</a><span class="mx-2">|</span></span><span><a href="#" class="hover:underline">dark</a></span></div></div></div></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Risk parity portfolios","date":"2022-02-04T12:00:00.000Z","slug":"risk-parity-portfolios","content":{"compiledSource":"var m=Object.defineProperty,u=Object.defineProperties;var d=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var l=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,n=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var s=(e,t,a)=\u003et in e?m(e,t,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:a}):e[t]=a,o=(e,t)=\u003e{for(var a in t||(t={}))l.call(t,a)\u0026\u0026s(e,a,t[a]);if(i)for(var a of i(t))n.call(t,a)\u0026\u0026s(e,a,t[a]);return e},h=(e,t)=\u003eu(e,d(t));var p=(e,t)=\u003e{var a={};for(var r in e)l.call(e,r)\u0026\u0026t.indexOf(r)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(a[r]=e[r]);if(e!=null\u0026\u0026i)for(var r of i(e))t.indexOf(r)\u003c0\u0026\u0026n.call(e,r)\u0026\u0026(a[r]=e[r]);return a};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(a){var r=a,{components:e}=r,t=p(r,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,h(o(o({},layoutProps),t),{components:e,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"p\",null,mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.
