His reward was getting to choose a song for me cover on YouTube - and here it is!\n\nThanks to my dad and other Kickstarter backers, I'm proud to be releasing my debut album, entitled \"Perennials.\"  To listen for free or to buy the physical disc and/or download, head here:\nhttp://music.iancanderson.com\n\nPS: I'm aware that I messed up one of the lyrics in the beginning (\"smile\" should be \"shine\").
